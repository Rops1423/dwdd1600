            <h2>What does XR mean?</h2>
            <!--<p>First thing to know is what is AR/MR/VR/XR. AR means Augmented Reality, an enhance, interactive version of the real world. MR stands for Mixed Reality, a reality where virtual and real objects co-exist and interact in real time. VR stands for Virtual Reality, a completely fake reality. XR means Extended Reality, is a catch-all term referring to AR, MR, VR.</p> -->
